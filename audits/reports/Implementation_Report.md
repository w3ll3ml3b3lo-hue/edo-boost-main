## EduBoost SA — Implementation Report (Rolling)

**Purpose**: Rolling log of implementation work performed in this repo, including what changed, why, verification evidence, and commit references.  
This report complements `audits/recommendations/Backend_Report.md` and `audits/recommendations/Functional_Implementations_Report.md` for cross-cutting changes.

### [2026-04-27] Kickoff: Backend functional verification + dummy data generator

**Refs**: `ACTIVE_TASKS.md`  
**Status**: In progress  

**What changed**:
- Created `ACTIVE_TASKS.md` to track live execution tasks.
- Created this rolling report to track implementation progress and commits.

**Why**:
- Establish a single source of truth for what’s being done and the evidence/commits that captured it.

**Verified by**:
- File presence and review.

**Commit**: `9d4b195`  
**Open issues**:
- Dummy data generator not yet implemented.

### [2026-04-27] Backend test hardening: dockerless + providerless `pytest`

**Status**: Complete  
**Commit**: `1332016`  

**What changed**:
- Added test-mode fallbacks so lesson/study plan/parent report flows don’t depend on external LLM providers or prompt-template DB seeds.
- Improved request validation (e.g., guardian email format) to meet contract tests.
- Hardened parent portal access checks and POPIA deletion consent checks for deterministic test behavior.

**Why**:
- Make the backend reliably testable in local/dev environments without Docker services (Postgres/Redis) and without API keys.

**Verified by**:
- `pytest` full suite green (224 passed) in local venv.

### [2026-04-27] Dummy data generator: post-startup + persistence floor

**Status**: Complete  
**Commit**: `568c5d0`  

**What changed**:
- Added `DummyDataPoint` model for large-volume synthetic points.
- Added `DummyDataService` to generate up to 10,000 points in the background after API startup.
- Added a persistence floor by marking a subset as persistent and only cleaning up non-persistent points.
- Added configuration knobs for enablement, target size, ratios, startup delay, and batch size.

**Why**:
- Enable silent, post-startup background population for demos/dev without impacting startup time.

**Verified by**:
- `pytest` full suite green (224 passed) after adding the dummy-data model + service.

### [2026-04-27] Frontend: Gamification + Learner State Refactor

**Status**: Complete (Pending Push)
**Commit**: `38f3ca4`

**What changed**:
- Refactored `LearnerContext` to include real-time mastery and gamification fetching.
- Integrated `InteractiveLesson` component into the learner dashboard.
- Added level and XP progress bars to the `Sidebar` shell.
- Updated `InteractiveDiagnostic` to trigger state refreshes on completion.
- Added diagnostic contract tests in `app/frontend/src/__tests__/`.

**Why**:
- Ensure the frontend accurately reflects the learner's progress and rewards without manual refreshes.
- Stabilize the API contract between frontend and the new backend services.

**Verified by**:
- Code review and consistency check with backend `DummyDataService` expectations.
