# EduBoost Agentic Execution Report

**Purpose:** This report acts as the twin to the [Agentic Execution Roadmap](../roadmaps/Agentic_Execution_Roadmap.md). It records the outcomes, test results, and commit hashes of the autonomous agent workflows.

## Phase 1: Test-Driven Autonomy (TDD)

### Epic 1: Redis Circuit Breaker Implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Test Coverage Target**: >90% for `FourthEstate` module.
- **Commit**: To be committed.
- **Notes**: Fixed tests by properly resetting `fe._redis` state between test phases. The circuit breaker correctly falls back when Redis connection fails and recovers when the timeout is reached.

### Epic 2: Celery Job Scheduling for Study Plans
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (2026-04-28)
- **Test Coverage Target**: Complete mock of `Anthropic` orchestration.
- **Commit**: N/A (tests created)
- **Notes**: 
  - Created `tests/integration/test_celery_study_plan.py` with 9 tests
  - Tests cover: task execution, retry config, beat schedule, orchestrator mocking
  - All 9 tests pass
  - Verified Celery worker connects to Redis and registers all tasks:
    - `eduboost.tasks.refresh_study_plan`
    - `eduboost.tasks.daily_plan_refresh`
    - `eduboost.tasks.weekly_parent_reports`
  - Worker successfully connected to `redis://localhost:6379/0`

## Phase 2: Out-Of-The-Box Autonomous Strategies

### Epic 3: Visual E2E Verification (Browser Subagent)
- **Status**: 🔴 Failed (Infrastructure Issue)
- **Browser Findings**: N/A
- **Commit**: N/A
- **Notes**: Attempted to open the browser subagent multiple times but encountered `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:9222`. The CDP port is unresponsive. We need user feedback on how to fix the environment.

### Epic 4: POPIA Chaos & Security Sweep
- **Status**: ✅ Completed
- **Vulnerabilities Found & Fixed**: Added POPIA `scrub_dict` utility to `get_learner` and `get_learner_progress` routes.
- **Commit**: To be committed.
- **Notes**:
  - `app/api/routers/learners.py` endpoints now properly utilize `app/api/services/inference_gateway.py::scrub_dict` to filter out Learner PII.
  - Also fixed `test_gamification_integration.py` and `test_gamification_service.py` to properly handle async mocks during XP distribution.
  - All tests passing.

## Phase 3: Continuous Improvements

### Epic 5: Gamification Test Hardening & Metrics (New)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (2026-04-28)
- **Commit**: To be committed.
- **Notes**: 
  - Integrated `BADGE_AWARDED_TOTAL` and `XP_AWARDED_TOTAL` Prometheus counters into `gamification_service.py`.
  - Added new test suite `TestGamificationMetrics` in `tests/unit/test_gamification_service.py` using `patch` to verify metrics are accurately tracking XP distributed and badges awarded.
  - Tests successfully passed.
