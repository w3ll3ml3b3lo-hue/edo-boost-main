# EduBoost SA Production Grade Roadmap

## Purpose

This document defines the work required to move EduBoost SA from a promising MVP/prototype into a truly production-grade platform for real learner traffic. It is structured as an engineering roadmap, not just a feature wishlist. The focus is reliability, safety, maintainability, educational correctness, operational excellence, and regulatory readiness.

The roadmap is organized into the following sections:

- Architecture
- Backend Quality
- Frontend Quality
- Privacy and Security
- Infra and DevOps
- Test Coverage and Quality Assurance
- Data and AI Governance
- Product and Accessibility Readiness
- Documentation and Team Enablement
- Execution Phases and Exit Criteria

---

## Current State Summary

EduBoost SA has reached a solid architectural foundation with all core pillars implemented:

- ✅ **5-Pillar Architecture**: Fully enforced via Orchestrator and WorkerAgent gates.
- ✅ **Migration Discipline**: Single-baseline Alembic workflow replaces manual SQL scripts.
- ✅ **Durable Audit**: RabbitMQ-backed event bus for immutable compliance logging.
- ✅ **Consent Gating**: Backend-enforced POPIA consent checkpoints and deletion workflows.
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: Integration tests for consent and E2E tests for learner journeys.
- ✅ **Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana stack with custom SLO dashboards.

## 1. Architecture

### Objective

Create a system architecture that is modular, enforceable, observable, and safe under production load.

### Required Work

#### 1.1 Establish the target architecture baseline

- Define the authoritative runtime architecture in one place.
- Standardize service boundaries between frontend, API, async workers, Redis, Postgres, and external AI providers.
- Decide and document which components are production-critical versus optional.
- Align repository structure with the actual architecture.

#### 1.2 Remove architecture drift

- Update the README to reflect the real repo layout.
- Remove references to directories or files that do not exist.
- Remove obsolete or duplicate implementation paths.
- Delete dead draft modules that can confuse maintainers.

#### 1.3 Formalize service boundaries

- Ensure all AI calls go through backend services only.
- Enforce that the frontend never calls model vendors directly.
- Route lesson generation, study plan generation, and parent report generation through a single reviewed orchestration path.
- Ensure privacy, validation, auditing, and rate limiting happen before vendor calls.

#### 1.4 Introduce clear domain layers

Target layers should be:

- routers/controllers
- request/response schemas
- domain services
- infrastructure adapters
- persistence layer
- policy and compliance layer

The code should avoid mixing these concerns in the same module.

#### 1.5 Adopt event-driven boundaries where needed

- Define which workflows must be synchronous versus asynchronous.
- Use Celery for long-running and retryable tasks.
- Emit auditable domain events for consent, lesson generation, report generation, deletion requests, and access to sensitive data.

#### 1.6 Define production non-functional requirements

Document and enforce targets for:

- availability
- response time
- recovery time
- backup and restore
- observability coverage
- data retention
- security posture

### Exit Criteria

Architecture is production-ready when:

- [x] the live implementation matches the documented design
- [x] there is exactly one approved path for each critical workflow
- [x] browser clients cannot bypass backend governance
- [x] async workloads are isolated from request/response traffic

## 11. Launch Readiness Checklist

The project should not be called truly production-grade until all of the following are true:

- browser clients cannot directly call AI providers
- guardian authentication is real and enforced
- consent is auditable and not just presented in UI
- DB schema changes are migration-driven
- secrets are managed securely
- backup and restore have been tested
- critical workflows have end-to-end tests
- observability and alerts exist for the learner journey
- deletion workflows are implemented and verified
- docs accurately represent the current system

---

## 12. Final Recommendation

The project is close to a strong production-capable foundation, but it needs a consolidation and hardening program before launch claims should be made. The immediate priority is not adding more features. It is enforcing the correct architecture, removing unsafe shortcuts, strengthening auth and privacy guarantees, and building operational confidence.

If executed in the phase order above, EduBoost SA can evolve from a polished MVP into a credible, safe, and maintainable production platform.
