# EduBoost SA — Functional Implementation Report

**Generated:** April 26, 2026  
**Last Updated:** April 27, 2026 (Docs sync: roadmap/report/README consistency)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive implementation log documenting all changes made to the EduBoost platform

---

## Overview

This document tracks functional implementation work for the EduBoost SA platform. It is a living record and must stay aligned with the repository state.

**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Core Learning Loop & Quality Hardening  
**Status:** Ongoing — codebase contains substantial backend implementations, but several earlier report statements had drifted from the real repository state.

---

## Documentation Correction Notice

A review of the current repository found that several earlier statements in this report were outdated.

### Corrections
- The Alembic baseline migration is **not empty**; it already contains full table creation statements.
- Study plans are **not stub-only**; `study_plan_service.py` and `study_plans.py` already implement generation, refresh, and rationale behavior.
- Gamification is **not absent**; service, router, leaderboard, badge, XP, and streak logic already exist.
- Parent portal behavior is **not stub-only**; progress summaries, trends, adherence, reports, export, deletion, and right-to-access paths already exist.
- The parent router had consistency problems and duplicate/legacy behavior, which is what the hardening branch began to address.

**Why this matters:** this report should distinguish between “feature not present” and “feature present but not yet hardened, integrated, or fully validated.”

## Implementation #10: Parent Portal API Hardening

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The parent portal had meaningful functionality already present, but its API layer had drifted into an inconsistent state:
- duplicate progress route behavior
- mismatched request/response shapes
- mixed legacy and newer endpoint behavior in the same router
- outdated documentation claiming the feature was still largely stubbed

### Changes Made

#### 10.1 Updated `app/api/models/api_models.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Aligned parent report request modeling with actual guardian-based report generation
- Simplified learner progress response shape to match the service payload returned by the parent portal service
- Reduced mismatch between API contracts and actual router/service behavior

**Why:** Ensures the API schema matches the implementation instead of preserving stale contract assumptions.

#### 10.2 Updated `app/api/routers/parent.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Removed duplicate/legacy progress handling patterns
- Standardized consent, deletion, export, and right-to-access route flow
- Simplified the router to use the parent and POPIA services consistently
- Replaced old event naming mismatch in consent recording with the consent event names actually used by the services

**Why:** Reduces ambiguity, makes future integration work easier, and lowers the risk of silent contract drift.

#### 10.3 Updated `app/api/services/parent_portal_service.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Improved consistency of progress/trend/adherence/export payloads
- Clarified guardian-aware export payload content
- Reduced schema drift issues in data export fields

**Why:** Makes parent portal responses more predictable for future frontend work and integration testing.

## Current Implementation Interpretation

The codebase is currently best understood as follows:

### Implemented but still needing hardening
- Adaptive diagnostic backend
- Lesson generation pipeline and guardrails
- Study plan generation and rationale APIs
- Gamification service and leaderboard paths
- Parent portal service, report generation, export, and deletion APIs
- Audit query/search support
- Baseline Alembic schema

### Still incomplete or not production-ready
- Full in-house model ownership and training pipeline
- Frontend feature completion and route decomposition
- CI/CD and release automation
- Broad integration and end-to-end validation coverage
- Stronger privacy/deletion correctness guarantees
- Operational observability, alerting, and incident runbooks

## Implementation #11: Study Plan Integration Tests

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The roadmap called for integration tests covering plan generation, save, fetch, update cycles, plus tests for conflict, overload, and sparse-data scenarios. The existing unit tests covered core algorithm behavior but lacked end-to-end flow validation.

### Changes Made

#### 11.1 Created `tests/integration/test_study_plan_integration.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Added 14 comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - Plan generation, save, fetch, and refresh cycles
  - Sparse data scenarios (no mastery records, no knowledge gaps)
  - Overload scenarios (many knowledge gaps)
  - Conflict scenarios (gap_ratio bounds enforcement)
  - Diagnostic linkage integration (concept-level gaps from diagnostics)
  - Grade band handling (R-3 vs 4-7)
  - Plan with rationale endpoint
  - Edge cases (Grade R, empty inputs)

**Why:** Validates the complete study plan lifecycle and ensures the service handles edge cases gracefully.

## Implementation #12: Gamification Integration Tests

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The roadmap called for integration tests covering reward issuance and progression updates. The gamification service had unit tests but lacked comprehensive integration tests validating the full XP award flow, streak mechanics, badge awarding, and leaderboard functionality.

### Changes Made

#### 12.1 Enhanced `app/api/services/gamification_service.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Added missing `award_xp()` method for lesson completion, mastery, diagnostics, etc.
- Added missing `update_streak()` method for daily streak tracking
- Added missing `get_leaderboard()` method for top learners by XP
- Added `_check_and_award_badges()` method for automatic badge awarding
- Added `_has_badge()` helper to check existing badges
- Added `_create_badge()` helper for badge creation
- Implemented discovery badges for Grade 4-7 learners (Explorer, Trailblazer, Pioneer, Pathfinder)
- Fixed streak bonus calculation (5 XP per streak day, max 50)
- Fixed grade band XP caps (R-3: 200, 4-7: 250)

**Why:** The gamification router referenced these methods but they were not implemented, causing runtime errors.

#### 12.2 Created `tests/integration/test_gamification_integration.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Added 19 comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - XP award flow (lesson_complete, level up detection, invalid types, learner not found)
  - Streak mechanics (continue streak, break streak, same day no change)
  - Grade band XP caps (R-3 max 200, 4-7 max 250)
  - Discovery badges for Grade 4-7 (no discovery badges for R-3)
  - Leaderboard (top learners, limit enforcement)
  - Badge award for streak thresholds
  - XP config validation (all required types, reasonable values)
  - Profile enrichment (grade band, level calculations, available badges)

**Why:** Validates the complete gamification lifecycle and ensures proper XP/streak/badge mechanics.

## Implementation #13: Privacy Hardening & Frontend Consumers

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The roadmap prioritized correcting the POPIA deletion workflow to ensure all learner data fragments were either destroyed or anonymized, and also called for updating frontend API consumers to match the now-stabilized backend contracts. 

### Changes Made

#### 13.1 Updated `app/api/services/popia_deletion_service.py`

**Technical Details:**
- Added deletion of `LearnerBadge` entities to scrub user-generated gamification evidence.
- Added anonymization of `DiagnosticResponse` records (`learner_response = "ANONYMIZED"`) to ensure no potentially identifying text remains in assessment history.
- Audited the "session invalidation" flow, determining that the backend relies on stateless JWTs coupled with an identity check during login; marking the identity as deleted correctly halts all new session creation.

**Why:** Ensures the right-to-erasure guarantees hold up against the actual database schema and leave no PII behind.

#### 13.2 Updated `app/frontend/src/components/eduboost/api.js`

**Technical Details:**
- Added `guardianLoginAPI` and `learnerSessionAPI` for identity.
- Added gamification consumers: `getLearnerProfileAPI`, `awardXPAPI`.
- Added privacy consumers matching the parent portal router: `requestDeletionAPI`, `getDeletionStatusAPI`, `exportDataAPI`.

**Why:** Aligns the frontend API surface with the stabilized backend routers, moving towards full replacement of the mock state behavior.

## Implementation #14: Frontend Architecture De-Monolithing

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The `EduBoostApp.jsx` component was a monolithic state holder that conditionally rendered all screens and feature panels using a large central state object. To support individual feature evolution, URL-based sharing, and Next.js routing patterns, we needed to decompose it into standard App Router pages.

### Changes Made

#### 14.1 Replaced `EduBoostApp.jsx` with Next.js App Router
**Technical Details:**
- Created `LearnerContext.jsx` to host cross-cutting state (learner profile, mastery data, notifications).
- Created `app/page.jsx`, `app/onboarding/page.jsx`, and `app/parent-gateway/page.jsx` as root entrypoints.
- Created an authenticated shell layout `app/learner/layout.jsx` that automatically provisions the navigation `Sidebar`.
- Decomposed the 6 core feature panels into their own routes: `/learner/dashboard`, `/learner/diagnostic`, `/learner/lesson`, `/learner/plan`, `/learner/badges`, and `/learner/parent`.

**Why:** Decouples feature development, enables standard browser history/back-button behaviors, and allows for clean code-splitting boundaries.

---

## Implementation #15: CI/CD and Validation Setup

### Date: April 26, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
The codebase required automated validation for its Python backend and its newly decomposed React frontend to prevent regressions. Introducing local pre-commit hooks ensures standard formatting (Black/Prettier), and GitHub Actions guarantees the pipeline is continually tested before merges.

### Changes Made
- Configured **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** for the `app/frontend` UI, adding unit tests for `DashboardPanel` and `DiagnosticPanel`.
- Set up `.pre-commit-config.yaml` enforcing `black`, `isort`, `flake8`, and `prettier`.
- Set up `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `pytest` alongside `npm test` and `npm run build`.

## Documentation Maintenance Rule

Whenever implementation work changes the real status of a feature, update both:
- `Functional_Implementation_Roadmap.md`
- `audits/recommendations/Functional_Implementations_Report.md`

This avoids roadmap/report drift and keeps planning grounded in the real repository.

---

## Implementation #16: Docs Consistency Sync (Roadmaps + README)

### Date: April 27, 2026

### Technical Reasoning
Several markdown artifacts (README + functional/production roadmaps) had small but meaningful drift (e.g., lesson caching status, item bank seeding characterization, and centralized API client completion). This creates confusion and undermines execution tracking.

### Changes Made
- Updated `Functional_Implementation_Roadmap.md` to reflect that backend lesson caching exists and to clarify item bank seeding status as “present but needs expansion.”
- Updated `README.md` “Current State” language to avoid stale statements and emphasize ongoing hardening/validation.
- Updated `Production_Roadmap_Issue_Tracker.md` to mark already-completed items as complete/in progress in line with the phased checklist.

### Result
Docs are aligned with each other and better reflect the repository’s current direction, reducing planning ambiguity.
