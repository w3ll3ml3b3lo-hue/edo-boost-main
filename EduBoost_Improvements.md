# EduBoost SA Implementation Improvement Roadmap
**Five-Pillar Constitutional Architecture · Phases 1–4**

This document consolidates the technical improvement backlog for EduBoost SA, combining the original Phase 1–3 roadmap with a detailed review of the current codebase. Items are grouped by severity and strategic impact. Each todo is actionable with a clear scope and rationale.

## Phases at a Glance
Phases are colour-coded based on priority and focus areas:

| Phase | Focus | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | Critical Bugs & Security | Fix Before Any User Traffic (6 items) |
| **Phase 2** | Pipeline Completion | Wire Up Missing Five-Pillar Paths (5 items) |
| **Phase 3** | Optimisation & Developer Experience | Reduce fragility and improve maintainability (5 items) |
| **Phase 4** | Pedagogical & Accessibility Hardening | Deepen educational quality and broaden accessibility (5 items) |

## 🔴 Phase 1: Critical Bugs & Security
*Must be resolved before any real learner traffic. These items involve broken functionality, POPIA exposure, or authentication bypass.*

1.  **Delete `app/api/services/lessons_router.py`**
    * **Rationale:** This file is a dead draft superseded by `app/api/routers/lessons.py`. It contains non-existent imports (`from orchestrator import OperationRequest`) that cause `ImportError`.
    * **Action:** Remove the file entirely and add a linting rule to prevent future accumulation of dead code.

2.  **Fix guardian authentication: verify guardian exists before minting JWT**
    * **Rationale:** The `POST /api/v1/auth/guardian/login` handler currently returns a signed JWT without verifying if the `learner_pseudonym_id` exists or if the email matches stored records.
    * **Action:** Add a database lookup against `learner_identities` to decrypt and compare stored emails before issuing tokens. Return HTTP 401 on failure.

3.  **Route frontend lesson generation through the FastAPI backend, not the Anthropic API directly**
    * **Rationale:** `EduBoostApp.jsx` currently calls Anthropic directly, bypassing the Judiciary, Fourth Estate audit, and PII scrubber. This exposes PII and violates POPIA.
    * **Action:** Replace `callClaude()` in the frontend with a call to the backend `/api/v1/lessons/generate`. Remove all direct Anthropic calls from the frontend.

4.  **Upgrade learner ID hashing to use a salted SHA-256 (HMAC)**
    * **Rationale:** Current plain SHA-256 hashes of UUIDs are vulnerable to brute-force reversal.
    * **Action:** Replace plain hashing in `orchestrator.py` and `profiler.py` with `hmac.new(SALT.encode(), learner_id.encode(), 'sha256')` using a secret `ENCRYPTION_SALT`.

5.  **Replace the synchronous `Anthropic()` client with `AsyncAnthropic()`**
    * **Rationale:** The blocking synchronous client in `inference_gateway.py` stalls the FastAPI event loop for 2–8 seconds per call, serializing all requests under load.
    * **Action:** Implement `AsyncAnthropic()` and use `await client.messages.create(...)`.

6.  **Validate LLM JSON output with Pydantic before it reaches downstream layers**
    * **Rationale:** Schema mismatches in LLM output currently cause opaque 500 errors.
    * **Action:** Wrap parsing with `model_validate()` and catch `ValidationError`. Return HTTP 422 with structured errors instead of raw LLM output.

---

## 🟠 Phase 2: Pipeline Completion
*The five-pillar architecture is designed but only partially wired. These items close the gaps between the design and what is actually executed at runtime.*

7.  **Wire `FourthEstate` singleton to `settings.REDIS_URL`**
    * **Rationale:** The audit bus currently defaults to an in-memory `deque` capped at 1000 events, which is lost on restart.
    * **Action:** Update the factory to use `FourthEstate(redis_url=settings.REDIS_URL, ...)` to activate the permanent regulatory-grade audit trail.

8.  **Implement Redis read/write in the Ether Profiler (Pillar 5)**
    * **Rationale:** The profiler currently returns default profiles and never saves computed archetypes to Redis, causing every lesson to use default tone parameters.
    * **Action:** Implement Redis `get` and `setex` logic in `EtherProfiler` to store and retrieve `LearnerEtherProfile` data.

9.  **Add `GENERATE_STUDY_PLAN` and `GENERATE_PARENT_REPORT` to `ActionType` and route through Orchestrator**
    * **Rationale:** These endpoints currently bypass the Orchestrator, Judiciary, and Fourth Estate audit bus.
    * **Action:** Update the `ActionType` enum, add constitutional rules (POPIA_01, PII_01) to the corpus, and route these actions through the Orchestrator.

10. **Implement lesson caching and return `lesson_id` from the generation endpoint**
    * **Rationale:** Generated lessons are currently not stored, causing the `GET /api/v1/lessons/{lesson_id}` endpoint to always return 404.
    * **Action:** Generate a UUID `lesson_id` upon generation, store the JSON in Redis with `SETEX`, and include the ID in the API response.

11. **Add input schema validation to `generate_study_plan` and `generate_parent_report`**
    * **Rationale:** Current functions accept raw primitives, potentially allowing PII to bypass Judiciary review.
    * **Action:** Create `StudyPlanParams` and `ParentReportParams` Pydantic models with strict validation to reject unknown keys.

## 🟡 Phase 3: Optimisation & Developer Experience
*These items reduce fragility, improve maintainability, and close subtle correctness issues.*

12. **Add a Redis circuit breaker and local-log fallback to the Fourth Estate audit bus**
    * **Rationale:** If Redis is down, audit events are currently lost.
    * **Action:** Implement a circuit breaker that falls back to a local JSONL log file after three failures and emits Prometheus metrics.

13. **Reconcile PII regex patterns between `inference_gateway.py` and `judiciary.py`**
    * **Rationale:** Different files use different regex for South African phone numbers (some missing 08x and 09x ranges).
    * **Action:** Centralize patterns in `app/api/core/pii_patterns.py` and add regression tests for mastery scores (e.g., ensuring `0.62` isn't flagged as a number).

14. **Externalise prompt strings into Jinja2 templates in a `/prompts` directory**
    * **Rationale:** Prompts are currently hardcoded in Python, making it difficult for curriculum experts to edit them without touching code.
    * **Action:** Move prompts to `.jinja2` files and wire them to the existing `PromptTemplate` database table for RLHF tracking.

15. **Document Ether archetypes and add a seeding fixture for development**
    * **Rationale:** Kabbalistic names like `KETER` and `YESOD` are opaque to new contributors.
    * **Action:** Add a docstring mapping archetypes to behavioral meanings and create a test fixture factory for integration testing.

16. **Separate `--cov` flags into a dedicated `make coverage` target**
    * **Rationale:** Running coverage on every test adds significant overhead to the TDD loop.
    * **Action:** Move coverage flags from `pytest.ini` to a `Makefile` or `pyproject.toml` to keep standard test runs fast.

## 🟢 Phase 4: Pedagogical & Accessibility Hardening
*Focuses on Grade R–1 voice interaction, stateful diagnostics, and offline support.*

17. [cite_start]**Implement the STT/TTS gateway for Grade R–1 voice interaction** [cite: 27]
    * **Rationale:** Young learners (ages 5–7) cannot always read; voice interaction is required for accessibility.
    * **Action:** Create a `VoiceGateway` wrapping a provider like Whisper, handle transcript PII scrubbing, and add `GENERATE_VOICE_RESPONSE` logic.

18. [cite_start]**Convert the diagnostic endpoint into a stateful real-time session** [cite: 28]
    * **Rationale:** The current endpoint simulates answers rather than conducting a real session.
    * **Action:** Implement `/session/start` and `/session/{id}/answer` endpoints, storing Item Response Theory (IRT) state in Redis.

19. [cite_start]**Refactor the Judiciary to use a Strategy Pattern for subject-specific rule sets** [cite: 29]
    * **Rationale:** Validation rules for Maths vs. Language will diverge as the system grows.
    * **Action:** Implement a `JudiciaryStrategy` protocol to allow adding new subjects via specific strategy instances rather than complex `if/else` chains.

20. [cite_start]**Implement Celery tasks for the RLHF feedback loop and weekly study plan regeneration** [cite: 30]
    * **Rationale:** Infrastructure for Celery exists, but no tasks are running.
    * **Action:** Create tasks for nightly feedback processing (RLHF) and Sunday night study plan regeneration.

21. [cite_start]**Add offline-mode service worker and local lesson cache for low-connectivity learners** [cite: 31]
    * **Rationale:** Many South African learners have intermittent internet access.
    * **Action:** Implement a Next.js service worker using IndexedDB to cache the last 5 lessons and current study plan.
