## 📋 Overview

EduBoost SA is an adaptive learning platform built on a "Five Pillar" architecture to ensure pedagogical alignment, operational excellence, and strict POPIA compliance. The platform provides personalized learning journeys for South African students while maintaining high standards for data privacy and educational quality.

### Key Features
- 🧠 **Adaptive Diagnostic Engine** — IRT-based (Item Response Theory) assessments that find the exact grade level of each knowledge gap.
- 🤖 **AI Lesson Generation** — Claude/Llama 3 powered lessons with authentic South African context (ubuntu, braai, rands, local fauna).
- 📅 **Dynamic Study Plans** — CAPS-aligned weekly schedules that prioritise foundation gaps while keeping pace with grade-level work.
- 🏆 **Gamification** — XP, badges, streaks for Grade R–3; discovery-based engagement for Grade 4–7.
- 🔒 **POPIA-Grade Privacy** — Backend-enforced parental consent, pseudonymous learner IDs, and a durable audit trail.
- 📊 **Parent Portal** — AI-generated progress reports, right-to-access exports, and granular consent management.
- 🇿🇦 **Multilingual Support** — CAPS-aligned lessons in English, isiZulu, Afrikaans, and isiXhosa.
- 📱 **Offline-Ready PWA** — Service worker and manifest support for installation and offline resilience.
- 🧠 **RLHF Pipeline** — Learner feedback collection for continuous AI lesson quality improvement.

## ⚠️ Current State

EduBoost SA is currently in its **Beta** phase, with core architectural pillars fully implemented:

- ✅ **Pillar 2 (Executive)**: Backend-mediated lesson generation and study plan workflows.
- ✅ **Pillar 3 (Judiciary)**: Constitutional policy enforcement via the Judiciary Stamp gate.
- ✅ **Pillar 4 (Fourth Estate)**: Durable, RabbitMQ-backed audit trail for POPIA compliance.
- ✅ **Pillar 5 (Ether)**: Psychological archetype profiling and adaptive prompt modification.
- ✅ **Microservices**: Decoupled AI inference into a dedicated service for optimized deployments.
- ✅ **Observability**: Prometheus/Grafana/Loki stack with business SLO dashboards.
- ✅ **Multilingual**: Native support for English, isiZulu, Afrikaans, and isiXhosa.
- ✅ **Compliance**: Full ConsentService with right-to-erasure and versioned policy support.
- ✅ **PWA**: Installable web app with offline sync capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+

### 1. Clone & Configure
```bash
git clone <your-github-repo-url>
cd eduboost-sa
cp env.example .env
```

### 2. Start the Full Stack (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Services will be available at:

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |

| `DATABASE_URL` | Async SQLAlchemy connection string (Postgres) |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string (Cache/Celery) |
| `RABBITMQ_URL` | RabbitMQ connection string (Audit Trail/Broker) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Primary LLM inference key |

## 🔐 POPIA & Privacy

EduBoost SA implements privacy-by-design through:

1. **Consent Gating**: All learner data access requires a valid, non-expired `ParentalConsent` record.
2. **Pseudonymisation**: Real learner identities are never passed to LLM providers; opaque `pseudonym_id`s are used instead.
3. **Durable Audit**: Every sensitive action and constitutional review is logged to a persistent RabbitMQ exchange.
4. **Right to Erasure**: Guardian-initiated deletion workflows atomically revoke consent and soft-delete personal data.
5. **PII Scrubbing**: Prompt paths are audited via the "Chaos Sweep" scripts to prevent leakage.

---

## 📈 Monitoring

The stack includes pre-configured Grafana dashboards covering:
*   **Learner Journey SLOs**: Tracking diagnostic completion and lesson efficacy.
*   **LLM Provider Health**: Latency and success rates across providers.
*   **Constitutional Health**: Approval rates and violation trends.
*   **Centralised Logs**: Integrated Grafana Loki and Promtail for unified log aggregation.
